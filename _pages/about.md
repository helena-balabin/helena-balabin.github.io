I am an interdisciplinary PhD student at the departments of Neurosciences and Computer Science at KU Leuven, jointly supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lpW2FyoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Prof. Rik Vandenberghe</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O9hYMUUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Prof. Marie-Francine (Sien) Moens</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Natural Langugage Processing and neurolinguistics, ranging from fundamental research to clinical applications. 

Prior to starting my PhD in Belgium, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences in Sankt Augustin, Germany. During that time, I have also worked for three years as a student research assistant at the Bioinformatics department of the Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing.

I am very passionate about sports in any form, whether it's running (half-)marathons and trail races, practicing taekwondo or hiking. I also love drum and bass festivals and road trips to remote places.
